                <h3>Get to know about me!</h3>
                <p>I live in Marikina City, the cleanest city in Metro Manila! I am currently 21 years old.
                    I love to workout and play soccer. I am a huge fan of Lionel Messi and FC Barcelona. Since I live in the 
                    Philippines, which basketball is the most popular sport, I only play several times a week.
                    In my spare time I study programming languages and develop websites.
